# BetterJoy v6.1 - DS4 Gyro
This is an experimental branch of BetterJoy that uses a custom build of ViGEm to allow the use of DS4 gyro/accel controls. For more info, please see [the following wiki page](https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy/wiki/DS4-Gyro).

I will merge this branch into master once ViGEm updates to include the gyro API (we're working on it)
